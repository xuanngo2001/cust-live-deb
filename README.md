Set of scripts to create Custom Live Debian System:
* Automatically calculate space used of each script.
* It can remaster itself while running.

# Screenshots

# Download( TODO )
It comes in 2 flavors:
* min: Strict minimum system with JWM light-weight window manager. From there, you can add your desired applications.
* std: Standard system includes minimum system + common applications.

# Create hybrid ISO

1. Clone the git repository(e.g. `git clone https://github.com/limelime/cust-live-deb.git`)
1. Import the wiki to `./scripts/settings/doc/`.
1. `./cld.sh <SYSTEM> <DEB_REPO_URL>`. 
    * **SYSTEM** can be:
        * min: Strict minimum system with JWM light-weight window manager. From there, you can add your desired applications.
        * std: Standard system includes minimum system + common applications.
        * all: Will execute all scripts in `./scripts/repository/`.
    * **DEB_REPO_URL** is the URL to the Debian repository(e.g. http://ftp.debian.org/debian/).
1. `cust-live-deb-64-<SYSTEM>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.iso` will be created.
