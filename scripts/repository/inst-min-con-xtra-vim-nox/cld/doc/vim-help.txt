# Wrapping
    For preventing vim from wrapping long lines I use these two lines in my .vimrc:
    set nowrap           " do not automatically wrap on load
    set formatoptions-=t " do not automatically wrap text when typing


# Tab: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Converting_tabs_to_spaces
    set expandtab       "Insert space when tab key is pressed. To enter a real tab character use Ctrl-V<Tab>.
    set tabstop=4       "Insert 4 spaces for TAB.
    set shiftwidth=4    "??To change the number of space characters inserted for indentation??
    :retab              " Change all existing TAB characters to match the current tab settings.
    set softtabstop=4   " To cause <Tab> and <BS> to insert and delete the correct number of spaces.
