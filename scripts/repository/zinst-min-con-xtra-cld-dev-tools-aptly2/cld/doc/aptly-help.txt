        Looks like some keys are missing in your trusted keyring, you may consider importing them from keyserver:

        gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45
    
    gpg --export --armor CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45 | apt-key add -
